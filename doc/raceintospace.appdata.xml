    Race Into Space is a simulation of the US-Soviet Space Race.
    In it, you take charge of your country’s space program as
    Director (US) or Designer (USSR). You will purchase and develop
    space hardware, recruit and manage astronauts/cosmonauts, and
    plan and send missions into space. The ultimate goal is to be
    the first to complete a Moon landing and return your people
    safely to Earth.

    <p>
    Race Into Space (RIS) is a port to modern operating systems of
    Buzz Aldrin’s Race Into Space (BARIS), a DOS game originally released
    in 1993 on floppy disk, and a year later in an expanded CD version.
    BARIS was developed by Fritz Bronner based on his 1989 board game Liftoff!.
    Dr. Aldrin’s name and imagery have been dropped because permission to
    use them was limited to the old DOS game.
    </p>

    <p>
    RIS is available for Windows, Linux, and Mac, and includes some
    improvements over the original game—which we feel have justified
    a rewrite of the game manual. Those involved in RIS are volunteer
    enthusiasts, and we hope you enjoy this simulation.
    You might even find it educational.
